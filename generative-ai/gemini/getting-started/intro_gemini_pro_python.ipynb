    "The Vertex AI Gemini API provides a unified interface for interacting with Gemini models. There are two Gemini 1.0 Pro models available in the Gemini API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemini 1.0 Pro model** (`gemini-1.0-pro`): Designed to handle natural language tasks, multi-turn text and code chat, and code generation.\n",
    "- **Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model** (`gemini-1.0-pro-vision`): Supports multimodal prompts. You can include text, images, and video in your prompt requests and get text or code responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interact with the Gemini API using the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use [Vertex AI Studio](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio) for quick testing and command generation\n",
    "- Use cURL commands\n",
    "- Use the Vertex AI SDK\n",

      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight is composed of all colors of the rainbow, each with a different wavelength. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the molecules of nitrogen and oxygen present in the air. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter blue light more effectively than other colors because of its shorter wavelength. As a result, the scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions in the sky, making it appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight:** Sunlight is composed of all colors of the rainbow, each with a different wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors like red or yellow.\n",
      "2. **Rayleigh Scattering:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the molecules of nitrogen and oxygen present in the air. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light.\n",
      "3. **Scattering of Light:** The molecules scatter the light in all directions. However, they scatter blue light more effectively than other colors because of its shorter wavelength. This is because the scattering efficiency is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.\n",
      "4. **Blue Sky:** As a result of this scattering, blue light reaches our eyes from all directions in the sky, making it appear blue. This is why the sky appears blue during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some additional points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue light.** However, our eyes are less sensitive to violet light, so the sky appears predominantly blue.\n",
      "* **At sunrise and sunset, the sun is low in the sky.** This means that sunlight has to travel through more atmosphere to reach our eyes. As a result, more blue light is scattered away, and the sky appears red or orange.\n",
      "* **Clouds appear white because they contain water droplets.** These droplets are much larger than the molecules in the air, so they scatter all colors of light equally.\n",
